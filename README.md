# gen_TT_SStt_cards
Cards for Monte Carlo generation for pair production of vector like tops, each decaying to a new scalar and a standard model top, with a consequent all-hadronic top decay and a diphoton decay of one scalar with the second inclusive.  This is a 2d mass bump search, requiring a 2d mass grid for MC generation (VL top masses are found in masspoints_T.txt and scalar masses are found in masspoints_S.txt).

NOTE: this generation uses a new pair production VLQ model for CMS, eVLQ_v8.1.tar.gz, found at https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/NLOModels.
