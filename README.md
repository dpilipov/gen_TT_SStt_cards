# gen_TT_SStt_cards
Cards for Monte Carlo generation for pair production of vector like tops, each decaying to a new scalar and a standard model top, with a consequent all-hadronic top decay and a diphoton decay of one scalar with the second inclusive.

NOTE: this generation uses a new pair production VLQ model for CMS, <img width="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/dpilipov/gen_TT_SStt_cards/assets/71142204/021416ad-5e90-4d16-b32b-4ecc1238e1e5">
